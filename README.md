# Simple Neuron Network for symbol classification
<p> Simple Neuron Network for small images with nine digits and a zero

<br> <br> Neorn Network has 2 hiden layers, and studying on the 5000 iterations 
<br> <br> Training set - 100 images 5x3 pixels (with some defects)
<br>      Test set - 5 artificially-generated images 5x3 pixels 
<br> <br> Output: 5 generated images and prediction rate on the plot</p>
